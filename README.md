Browser Extensions Browser extensions are small software programs that add features or functionality to your web browser â€” like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

They can change how websites behave, add tools to your browser, or help you do things more efficiently.

Example:Ad blockers, Password managers, Language tools etc...

We usually download them from official web stores like Chrome Web Store (for Google Chrome), Firefox Add-ons (for Mozilla Firefox).

Avoid sideloaded extensions unless you trust the source.

Review permissions ,When installing, most browsers show you the permissions the extension requires choose only the needed one.

Look for behaviour of the browser, Is the browser slower since installing?
